Description: Set of generalised tools for the flexible computation of climate related indicators defined by the user. Each method represents a specific mathematical approach which is combined with the possibility to select an arbitrary time period to define the indicator. This enables a wide range of possibilities to tailor the most suitable indicator for each particular climate service application (agriculture, food security, energy, water management…). This package is intended for sub-seasonal, seasonal and decadal climate predictions, but its methods are also applicable to other time-scales, provided the dimensional structure of the input is maintained. Additionally, the outputs of the functions in this package are compatible with 'CSTools'. This package was developed in the context of H2020 MED-GOLD (776467) and S2S4E (776787) projects.
