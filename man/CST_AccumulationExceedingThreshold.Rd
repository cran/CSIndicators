\usage{
CST_AccumulationExceedingThreshold(
  data,
  threshold,
  op = ">",
  diff = FALSE,
  start = NULL,
  end = NULL,
  time_dim = "ftime",
  na.rm = FALSE,
  ncores = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{An 's2dv_cube' object as provided by function \code{CST_Load} in 
package CSTools.}

\item{threshold}{An 's2dv_cube' object as output of a 'CST_' function in the
same units as parameter 'data' and with the common dimensions of the element 
'data' of the same length. A single scalar is also possible.}

\item{op}{An operator '>' (by default), '<', '>=' or '<='.}

\item{diff}{A logical value indicating whether to accumulate the difference
between data and threshold (TRUE) or not (FALSE by default).}

\item{start}{An optional parameter to defined the initial date of the period
to select from the data by providing a list of two elements: the initial
date of the period and the initial month of the period. By default it is set
to NULL and the indicator is computed using all the data provided in
\code{data}.}

\item{end}{An optional parameter to defined the final date of the period to
select from the data by providing a list of two elements: the final day of
the period and the final month of the period. By default it is set to NULL
and the indicator is computed using all the data provided in \code{data}.}

\item{time_dim}{A character string indicating the name of the dimension to
compute the indicator. By default, it is set to 'ftime'. More than one
dimension name matching the dimensions provided in the object
\code{data$data} can be specified.}

\item{na.rm}{A logical value indicating whether to ignore NA values (TRUE) or
not (FALSE).}

\item{ncores}{An integer indicating the number of cores to use in parallel
computation.}
}
\value{
A 's2dv_cube' object containing the indicator in the element \code{data}.
}
\description{
The accumulation (sum) of a variable in the days (or time steps) that the 
variable is exceeding (or not exceeding) a threshold during a period. The 
threshold provided must be in the same units than the variable units, i.e. to 
use a percentile as a scalar, the function \code{Threshold} or 
\code{QThreshold} may be needed. Providing mean daily temperature data, the 
following agriculture indices for heat stress can be obtained by using this 
function:
\itemize{
 \item\code{GDD}{Summation of daily differences between daily average 
                 temperatures and 10Â°C between April 1st and October 31st}
}
}

exp <- NULL

class(exp) <- 's2dv_cube'
