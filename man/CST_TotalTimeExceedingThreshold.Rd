\usage{
CST_TotalTimeExceedingThreshold(
  data,
  threshold,
  op = ">",
  start = NULL,
  end = NULL,
  time_dim = "time",
  na.rm = FALSE,
  ncores = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{An 's2dv_cube' object as provided function \code{CST_Start} or 
\code{CST_Load} in package CSTools.}

\item{threshold}{If only one threshold is used, it can be an 's2dv_cube' 
object or a multidimensional array with named dimensions. It must be in the 
same units and with the common dimensions of the same length as parameter 
'data'. It can also be a vector with the same length of 'time_dim' from 
'data' or a scalar. If we want to use two thresholds: it can be a vector 
of two scalars, a list of two vectors with the same length of 
'time_dim' from 'data' or a list of two multidimensional arrays with the 
common dimensions of the same length as parameter 'data'. If two thresholds
are used, parameter 'op' must be also a vector of two elements.}

\item{op}{An operator '>' (by default), '<', '>=' or '<='. If  two thresholds
are used it has to be a vector of a pair of two logical operators: 
c('<', '>'), c('<', '>='), c('<=', '>'), c('<=', '>='), c('>', '<'), 
c('>', '<='), c('>=', '<'),c('>=', '<=')).}

\item{start}{An optional parameter to define the initial date of the period 
to select from the data by providing a list of two elements: the initial 
date of the period and the initial month of the period. By default it is set
to NULL and the indicator is computed using all the data provided in 
\code{data}.}

\item{end}{An optional parameter to define the final date of the period to 
select from the data by providing a list of two elements: the final day of 
the period and the final month of the period. By default it is set to NULL 
and the indicator is computed using all the data provided in \code{data}.}

\item{time_dim}{A character string indicating the name of the dimension to 
compute the indicator. By default, it is set to 'time'. It can only
indicate one time dimension.}

\item{na.rm}{A logical value indicating whether to ignore NA values (TRUE) or 
not (FALSE).}

\item{ncores}{An integer indicating the number of cores to use in parallel 
computation.}
}
\value{
An 's2dv_cube' object containing in element \code{data} the total 
number of the corresponding units of the data frequency that a variable is 
exceeding a threshold during a period with dimensions of the input parameter 
'data' except the dimension where the indicator has been computed. The 
'Dates' array is updated to the dates corresponding to the beginning of the 
aggregated time period. A new element called 'time_bounds' will be added into 
the 'attrs' element in the 's2dv_cube' object. It consists of a list 
containing two elements, the start and end dates of the aggregated period with 
the same dimensions of 'Dates' element.
}
\description{
The Total Time of a variable exceeding (or not) a Threshold. It returns the  
total number of days (if the data provided is daily, or the corresponding  
units of the data frequency) that a variable is exceeding a threshold 
during a period. The threshold provided must be in the same units as the 
variable units, i.e. to use a percentile as a scalar, the function 
\code{AbsToProbs} or \code{QThreshold}  may be needed (see examples). 
Providing maximum temperature daily data, the following agriculture 
indices for heat stress can be obtained by using this function:
\itemize{
 \item{'SU35', Total count of days when daily maximum temperatures exceed 
       35Â°C in the seven months from the start month given (e.g. from April 
       to October for start month of April).}
 \item{'SU36', Total count of days when daily maximum temperatures exceed 
       36 between June 21st and September 21st.}
 \item{'SU40', Total count of days when daily maximum temperatures exceed 
       40 between June 21st and September 21st.}
 \item{'Spr32', Total count of days when daily maximum temperatures exceed
       32 between April 21st and June 21st.}
}
